This webapp is created for the Capital One SES News API Challenge. 

The concept behind this webapp is simplicity. Therefore, the search interface and UI are minimalistic and clean. To search, the user types into the input and selects a category to search in (Entertainment, Technology, or Sports). Selecting a category functions as a "Search" or "Go" button, triggering the API and returning search results. If there is no input (i.e. empty string), the application will return all top news from the selected category. The results display the title, source, publish date, description (if provided), link, and image, if provided.
